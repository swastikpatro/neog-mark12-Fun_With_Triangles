## Is Triangle?

- Given 3 angles, app calculates whether that angle forms a triangle or not.
- Alerts if
  - - Any input is empty OR any input is -ve.
  - "Done" alert if output is shown.
  - "Cleared" alert if you click clear button.
- Clicking Clear button empties all input fields,empties the output.
- **(Additional feature)** If you click input with output showing for previous inputs, we assume you are changing the inputs, so we clear down the output.
- **(Additional feature)** If angle given to inputs are greater than 360deg we find its reference angle, for example lets consider 400 degree we convert it to 40 degree (reference angle). For more info, see this [image](https://useruploads.socratic.org/K5tA9ZP0Tv2tdzuHyRDY_refer%20angle%20400.png).
- Output highlighted with red or green depending triangle forms or not.

## Quiz

- Select your answers from all the questions and click "Submit" button to know your score.
- Alerts if
  - "Done" alert if output is shown.
  - "Cleared" alert if you click clear button.
- Clicking Clear button unselects all radio buttons & empties the output box.
- Output highlighted with red or green depending whether your score is above 5 or not.
- **(Additional feature)** Navbar gets fixed on scrolling down if the scrollHeight is greater than headerHeight.

## Hypotenuse

- Enter the base value, height value to get the hypotenuse.
- We are using hypotenuse formula to calculate the hypotenuse.
- Alerts if
  - Any input is empty, -ve or zero.
  - "Done" alert if output is shown.
  - "Cleared" alert if you click clear button.
- Clicking Clear button empties all input fields,empties the output.
- **(Additional feature)** If you click input with output showing for previous inputs, we assume you are changing the inputs, so we clear down the output.

## Area of triangle

- Enter the lengths of all 3 sides of a triangle, we'll claculate the area of that triangle.
- Alerts if
  - Any input is empty, -ve or zero.
  - "Done" alert if output is shown.
  - "Cleared" alert if you click clear button.
- Clicking Clear button empties all input fields,empties the output.
- **(Additional feature)** If you click input with output showing for previous inputs, we assume you are changing the inputs, so we clear down the output.
- Output shown with red or green depending whether your lengths form a triangle or not, if forms a triangle, output containing area of triangle is shown with green color.
